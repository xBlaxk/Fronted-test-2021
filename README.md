# Frontend-test-2021
Frontend test for job application in alternova 2021

This is a webpage made as a practic test.

The page is a mini market interface, you can add items into shopping cart with a limited stock,
the items to buy are generated from a .JSON file, it reads the json file and fill a <div> container with the information obtained from the .JSON

The page styling and scripting was no a major problem, the most difficult part was discover how to read a .JSON file without using Node.JS
